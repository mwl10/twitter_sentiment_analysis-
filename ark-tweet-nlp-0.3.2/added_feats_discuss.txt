These are the changes in sentiment accuracy as a result of adding the features Positive,
PosAff, Pos-verbs, Negative, Neg-verbs. The major difference was a decrease in accuracy 
for the RandomForst classifier; a drop in about a half percent in accuracy. I am not sure why this is the case as I would assume that by considering features that have to do with positive/negative wording would help in predicting the tweet's sentiment, but clearly this is not really the case.
